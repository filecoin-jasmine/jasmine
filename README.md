Open source platform for next generation distributed technology

## What is Jasmine Project?

Jasmine Project is an open source platform aiming to develop next generation distributed file system based on blockchain and distributed computing technologies. As distributed ledger technologies such as bitcoin and Ethereum revolutionize the crypto fintech space, emerging de-fi market sees unprecedent opportunities for leveraging landscape-changing technologies such as blockchain, AI, big data, next generation networking, and crypto assets. Privacy preserving data processing, distributed intelligence, consensus mechanism, and defi economy all call for a common infrastructure â€“ a distributed, efficient, reliable, secure, and scalable infrastructure over current best-effort age-old Internet.

The distributed file system is the common infrastructure Jasmin Project aims to develop over the current Internet and next generation platform. Its purpose is to build a common and inter-operable platform to support emerging distributed storage system such as FileCoin/IPFS as well as existing public and private cloud infrastructure. Jasmine Project will support cross-layer development, supporting distributed networking, storage, computation, consensus, as well as enabling a range of ToB and ToC applications.
